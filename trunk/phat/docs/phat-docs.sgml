    <title>PHAT Overview</title>

    <partintro>

      <para>PHAT is a library of <ulink
      url="http://www.gtk.org">GTK+</ulink> widgets which are useful
      for pro-audio apps.  The name is a backronym which stands for
      "the PHat Audio Toolkit."</para>

	<para>If you're familiar with standard tarball compilation and
	installation procedures, then PHAT won't pose a problem for
	you.  If you're not used to the tarball dance, you'll still
	probably do just fine if you follow these instructions.</para>

	<para>Apart from having a generally sane Linux distribution
	and build environment, you need to have <ulink
	url="http://www.gtk.org">GTK+-2.0</ulink> or greater
	installed, along with it's development files.</para>

	<para>The magic incantantations to build and install PHAT are
	as follows:</para>

	<programlisting>
        tar -xzvpf phat.tar.gz
        cd phat.tar.gz
        ./configure
        make
        su
        &lt;enter root password&gt;
        make install
        /sbin/ldconfig
        </programlisting>

	<para>Replace "phat.tar.gz" above with the actual name of the
	package you downloaded and you should be golden.</para>

      </refsect1>

      <refsect1>
	<title>Other Systems</title> 

        <para>I don't see why PHAT should fail to build on other POSIX
	systems such as the BSDs, but I'm not supporting it either.
	If and when that "I" becomes a "we," that policy may
	change.</para>

	<para>If you're using Windows you're probably S.O.L., but that
	too could change in the future (see above).</para>

	which use PHAT</refpurpose>
      </refnamediv>
      <refsect1>
	<title>Compiling PHAT apps</title>

	<para>PHAT comes with a pkg-config .pc file, so using it is a
	snap. Run "man pkg-config" to learn how to make all your
	compilation dependcy woes disappear.</para>
